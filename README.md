# Decision Tree Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on implementing and analyzing Decision Tree models. The analysis explores how Decision Trees can be used for classification or regression tasks, depending on the dataset and problem requirements.

# Project Overview
The objectives of this project include:
Understanding the fundamentals of Decision Tree models.
Implementing a Decision Tree model using a structured dataset.
Evaluating model performance through various metrics.
Tuning hyperparameters to optimize the model for accuracy and efficiency.

# Notebook Contents
The main notebook file, Decision tree.ipynb, covers:
Data Preprocessing: Steps for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Model Implementation: Code for building the Decision Tree model.
Evaluation: Evaluation of model accuracy using metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, or mean squared error (for regression).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiments with different parameters to improve model performance.

# Requirements
To run the notebook, youâ€™ll need:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries (specified in the notebook)

# Usage
Open Decision tree.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
